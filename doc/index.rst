Genkgo/Mail - Modern PHP 7.4+ Mail Library
==========================================

Library to send e-mails over different transports and protocols (like SMTP) using immutable messages and streams. Also
includes SMTP server.


Why another Mail library for PHP?
---------------------------------

While analyzing what mail library to use when refactoring a code base, we discovered that the available ones are mostly
legacy libraries. Some do not use namespaces and every library we encountered was merely a collection of scalar property
bags than objects using encapsulation. Although we used these libs with joy in the past, they do not meet current quality
standards. So, we built a new and better library according to modern programming principles.

Use this if you want to send e-mails over different transports and protocols using immutable messages and streams.
